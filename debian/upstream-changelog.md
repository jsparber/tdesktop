# Version history for Telegram Desktop

## v1.0 (11.01.17)
 * Fabulous new material-style design and animations.
 * Support for custom themes! Check out some themes here: @themes.
 * Convenient tools for building your own themes coming soon.
 * Delete messages for everyone. When you delete your messages in groups and
   one-on-one chats, you can now choose to delete them for everyone in the chat,
   not just yourself. This works only for recently sent messages (same as
   editing).
 * Pin important chats to the top of the list so that you never miss a new
   message (right click on a chat, then choose ‘Pin to top’).
 * Groups in common. A new option in your contacts' profiles that shows a list
   of all groups you share with that person.
