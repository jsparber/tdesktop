telegram-desktop (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial build (Closes: #767418)

  * Fabulous new material-style design and animations.
  * Support for custom themes! Check out some themes here: @TelegramThemes.
  * Convenient tools for building your own themes coming soon.
  * Delete messages for everyone. When you delete your messages in groups and
    one-on-one chats, you can now choose to delete them for everyone in the
    chat, not just yourself. This works only for recently sent messages (same as
    editing).
  * Pin important chats to the top of the list so that you never miss a new
    message (right click on a chat, then choose ‘Pin to top’).
  * Groups in common. A new option in your contacts' profiles that shows a list
    of all groups you share with that person.
